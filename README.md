# ICO Sale of ASRs Tokens!
 
Implementation of my own crypto token to perform an ICO sale. This token is implemented in Solidity following the standard ERC-20 of Ethereum and it is deployed on Rinkeby test network (an Ethereum network for testing purposes). In terms of technologies, I used, as mention before, Solidity as the programming language for the back-end, and JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the front-end. It is all tested and has been deployed using Truffle framework. 

In case you want to download this descentralized application and run it, you'll need to install NPM as the package manager. As I was using Mac, I used HomeBrew to install it by typing "brew install npm". Then, the following packages or libraries are also necessaries:

1. Truffle framework to write, test and deploy smarts contracts in Solidity.
2. Ganache to provide us with a local ethereum test network. It has multiple accounts with 100 Ethers each one of them.
3. Web3js library to allow the user to interact with our smarts contracts (used in the front-end).
4. Metamask extension for Google Chrome (there is also one available for Firefox) to authenticate purchases of tokens.
5. Geth to deploy our local decentralized application to the "real" network. I mean "real" because we are actually deploying it on a test network called Rinkeby but it is not going to be available locally anymore

Do not hesitate to connect to my Decentralised Application and buy some ASR tokens!

In addition to the development, I've tried to prove how a project would work using Git concepts such as adding branches per functionallity, issues, use of canvas, milestones, pull requests and merges.
